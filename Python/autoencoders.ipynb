The policy-period combination is our unit of analysis: We will predict the probability of loss for time period 5 in the future - think of this as a potential renewal of the policy for which we need to predict whether it would make a loss for us or not hence affecting whether we decided to renew the policy and / or adjust the renewal premium to take into account the additional risk.

    "* Stride size can be altered. In our example we had no stride size however suppose that stride size was 1 and kernel size was 2, i.e., $\\alpha = \\left[\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\right]$, then we would apply the kernel $\\alpha$ at the start of the input, i.e., $\\left[x_1, x_2\\right] * \\left[\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\right]$, and move the kernel over the next area of the input, i.e., $\\left[x_2, x_3\\right] * \\left[\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2\\right]$, and so on and so forth until we arrive at a feature map that consists of 4 real values. This is called a valid convolution while a padded, i.e., say padded with zero values, convolution would give us a feature map that is the same size as the input, i.e., 5 real values in our example.\n",
    "* We can apply an activation function to the feature maps such as ELU mentioned earlier.\n",
    "* Finally we can summarize the information contained in feature maps by taking a maximum or average value over a defined portion of the feature map. For instance, if after using a valid convolution we arrive at a feature map of size 4 and then apply a max pooling operation with size 4 then we will be taking the maximum value of this feature map. The result is another feature map.\n",

    "This automates feature engineering however introduces architecture engineering where different architectures consisting of various convolution filters, activation functions, batch normalization layers, dropout layers and pooling operators can be stacked together in a pipeline in order to learn a good representation of the raw data. One usually creates an ensemble of such architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal behind convolutional autoencoders is to use convolution filters, activation functions, batch normalization layers, dropout layers and pooling operators to create an encoder function which will learn a good representation of our raw data. The decoder will also use a similar set of layers as the encoder to reconstruct the raw data with one exception: Instead of using a pooling operator it will use an upsampling operator. The basic idea behind the upsampling operator is to repeat an element a certain number of times say size 4: One can view this as the inverse operator to the pooling operator. The pooling operator is essentially a downsampling operator and the upsampling operator is simply the inverse of that in some sense.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have shown how to use deep learning and Bayesian inference to learn a good representation of raw data $X$, i.e., 1 or 2 or perhaps more dimensional tensors per unit of analysis, that can then perhaps be used for supervised learning tasks in the domain of computer vision and insurance. This moves us away from manual handcrafted feature engineering towards automatic feature engineering, i.e., representation learning. This does introduce architecture engineering however that can be automated as well perhaps by the use of genetic algorithms or reinforcement learning - a topic for another paper perhaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I would like to emphasize that the same code used for solving the computer vision task was used to solve the insurance task: In both tasks automatic feature engineering via deep learning had the best performance despite the fact that we were not explicitly looking for the best state of the art architecture possible."
